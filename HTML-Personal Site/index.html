                    <p>To be, or not to be: that is the question: whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of 
                        outrageous fortune, or to take arms against a sea of troubles, and by opposing end them? 
                        To die: to sleep; no more; and, by a sleep to say we end the heart-ache and the thousand natural 
                        shocks that flesh is heir to, 'tis a consummation devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep; to sleep: 
                        perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub; for in that sleep of death what dreams may come when we have 
                        shuffled off this mortal coil, must give us pause. There's the respect that makes calamity of so long a 
                        life; for who would bear the whips and scorns of time, the oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely, 
                        the pangs of dispriz'd love, the law's delay, the insolence of office, and the spurns that patient merit 
                        of the unworthy takes, when he himself might his quietus make with a bare bodkin? Who would fardels bear, 
                        to grunt and sweat under a weary life, but that the dread of something after death, the undiscover'd 
                        country from whose bourn no traveller returns, puzzles the will, and makes us rather bear those ills we 
                        have, than fly to others that we know not of? Thus consience doth make cowards of us all; and thus the 
                        native hue of resolution is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought, and enterprises of great pith 
                        and moment with this regard their currents turn awry, and lose the name of action.</p> </td>
